## Getting Started

Contributions to the ecosystem are welcome and encouraged! Here's how you can get started:

- Fork the repository
- Clone your forked repository
- Create a new branch
  - `feat/<feature-name>` for new features
  - `fix/<issue-name>` for bug fixes
  - `docs/<topic>` for documentation updates
  - `env/<environment-name>` for environment-related changes
  - `vX.Y.Z` / `vX.Y` for new releases (exclusively for maintainers)
- Make your changes
- Commit your changes
  - Add a message that explains the commit
  - Preferably, make small and focused commits
  - Make as many commits as you need, as long as sensible
  - Avoid weird messages like "stuff" (it's reserved for [AttAditya](https://github.com/AttAditya) only, since he's the only one maintaining the repository and can understand what "stuff" means since he wrote the code)
- Push your changes to your forked repository
- Open a pull request to the main repository
  - Start with the PR template
  - Provide a clear description of your changes and the problem they solve
  - Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes `#<issue-number>`")
